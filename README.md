# CSCI4600Project

Software Engineering final project.

Student Registration System in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

## What I Learned
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
  - Data persistence utilizing XML file
  - Serializing and deserializing objects 
  - Class inheritance
  - Implementing my first User Interface (UI), although not a very good one
  - Using a design pattern would have helped with tight coupling in the project
    - Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
